## üõ†Ô∏è Arhitecture & Technology Stack
The following architecture was used in the development of the system.
- **MVC:** Model-View-Controller is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (processes commands, makes calls to model objects), to facilitate efficient code organization and reuse.
The following technologies were used in the creation of the application.
- **C#, ASP.Net:** C# and ASP.Net form the backend framework, enabling robust server-side programming and application logic for web services and dynamic web content.
- **React:** React is the frontend JavaScript library used for building interactive user interfaces, known for its efficient rendering and state management in web applications.
- **MongoDB Atlas:** MongoDB Atlas serves as the cloud database platform, providing a fully-managed MongoDB service that offers scalability, high availability, and geographical distribution.
